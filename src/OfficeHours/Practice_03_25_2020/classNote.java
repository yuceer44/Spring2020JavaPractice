Practice Topics:
				Explicit casting
				If statement
				Ternary


primtive castings: implicit & explicit castings

	implicit casting: done automatically
			smaller primitive types can ALWAYS be assigned to larger primitive types

	explict casting: MUST be done manually
			casting larger primitive types to smaller one



if statements: when we execute a code fragment under certain condition

	single if statement: one condition, 1 option, one possiblity

				if(Condition){
					statementA;

				}

				statementA: execution depends on the condition



	if-else statement: two conditions, 2 options ==> only one can be choosed

					if(Condition){
						statementA;

					}else{  // otherwise
						statementB;

					}

					only one of the blocks gets executed
					statementA: gets executed if condition is true
					statementB: gets executed if the condition is false


	multi-branch if statement: 2+ options, or conditions

				if(Condition1){
						A;
				}else if(Condition2){
						B;
				}else if(Condition3){
						C;
				}else{
						D;
				}

				only one of the gets executed
				A: if condition1 is true
				B: if cindition1 is false, and condition 2 is true
				C: if both condition1&2 false, and condition3 is true
				D: if condition 1, 2, and 3 are false




	nested if statement: when we have pre-condition, and precondition can be evaluate to multiple scenarios

				if(Cindition){
					if(Condition){

					}

				}
